Here's the 2nd task, let me know if you have any questions, we also sent an invite for another test store, make sure to work on a duplicate theme and label it with your name.



Task#2
Task Overview:
We aim to implement a feature that allows customers to upgrade a product line item from a one-time purchase to a subscription plan and from subscription to one-time. 
This functionality needs to be user-friendly and available on both the slide cart and the cart page of our Shopify store.
Enable customers to seamlessly switch from a one-time purchase to a subscription plan and from subscription to one-time for products directly in the slide cart and on the cart page.
Ensure the user interface clearly indicates the option to upgrade to a subscription and is easy to use.
If a product has different selling plans, display a Subscribe & Save option for that cart item So that the user can switch to a subscription purchase.
After the product is upgraded to a subscription plan display a dropdown/selection box with different selling plan options including the one-time(Example SS attached SS#1).
Upon selection of any of the options the cart should update the line item with the selected selling plan (Example SS attached SS#2).
If a user selects one-time options the line item should downgrade to one-time purchase and should show the Subscribe & Save option.
Implement dynamic updates so that the cart reflects changes in real-time without requiring page reloads.
Technical Requirements:
Ensure seamless integration with the existing Shopify theme and cart functionality.
Use JavaScript to dynamically update the cart.
Maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
Ensure cross-browser compatibility.



Note from our devs: for the above task ask him to install the Seal Subscriptions app for creating selling plans for the products
